## JSX

JSX ignores undefined, null, booleans

JSX does not support objects


## ES6

### let + const

let cannot be redefinded but can reassigned

let name = 'george'; //Ok
name = 'Maria'       //Ok

let name = 'unknown'   //Error

const cannot be redefinded and cannot be reassigned

let and const are function scoped and block level scoped

### arrow functions

all arrow functions are anonymous

#### arguments objects

console.log(arguments) inside arrow function not works
no longer bound with arrow functions

####  this keyword - no longer bound
this keyword - no longer bound

es6 arrow functions no longer bind their own 'this' value, instead they use
the 'this' value of the context they were created in

## Data binding

jsx does not have built in data binding
we have to re-render page in order to see results

## Forms

e.preventDefault() -> prevents full page submit

### to get value
e.target.elements.{name of input}.value

## Validations

!!undefined = false

!!valid = true
